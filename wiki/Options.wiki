# Summary Options to be considered about standardizing EPUB at SC34.

=[1] Which "standards" type at ISO/IEC JTC1 ?= 

      * Technical Reports
      * Technical Specifications
      * International Standards

      Note: Internation Standards are better, but the other two might be good enough in first stage. 
               The first two options are much easier than Internation Standards.

=[2] Which version of IDPF EPUB ? =

      * EPUB 2.0.1
      * EPUB 3.0

      Note: EPUB 2.0.1 is needed to consider first because it is released to public on IDPF web site. 
               And EPUB 3.0 is under developing in IDPF.

=[3] Which process of ISO/IEC JTC1 ? =

      * Normal
      * PAS

      Note: "Fast-track" is not an option, since IDPF is not a country or region. If IDPF got a liason
                membership with JTC1, IDPF specifications can get fast-track. But this is not recommended 
                within national bodies in ISO/IEC JTC1.

=[4] What should be the real relationship between SC34 and IDPF ? =

       It is assumed that the two organizations have different committees and different chairs.


       == ODF model (SC34/WG6 and OASIS ODF TC) ==

          SC34 does not make any technical decisions. The ODF TC committee makes decisions.
          OASIS ODF and ISO/IEC ODF should be in sync, but there have been serious timing issues.

       == Unicode model (SC2 and Unicode consortium) ==

          Some technical decisions  (e.g., CJK) are made in SC2 IRG, but most of the technical decisions 
          are made in the Unicode Consortium.
          Unicode and 10646 are not identical. They share the same character names and code values.

       == OOXML model (SC34/WG4 and Ecma TC46) ==

          Technical decisions are made only in SC34.  Ecma members actively participate in all WG4 meetings.

          ISO/IEC OOXML and Ecma OOXML should in sync (subtle timing issues exist 
          but they have been minimized).

       = Inputs from SC34 and JTC1 member bodies  =

          Ballots in SC34 and JTC1 will lead to some technical changes, since there will be some sensible 
          technical comments from member bodies. Moreover, SC34 member bodies will submit defect 
          reports, which should be handled.
