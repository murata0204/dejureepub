#summary A list of time frame options

As shown in [http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/wiki/MovingTargetRiskManagement MovingTargetRiskManagement], some specifications normatively referenced in the EPUB3 specifications are moving targets.  When these specifications, IDPF may well create a minor version (3.1 or 3.0.1?).

IDPF might want to create minor versions of EPUB3 for different reasons, for example for dropping seemingly-useful-but-at-risk-of-not-being-implemented features.

 * Option 1: Immediately after the completion of EPUB3.0 at IDPF in 2011-07?
   * Pros
      * International standardization by ISO, IEC, or JTC1 can be started in a timely manner.
      * Inputs from member bodies may help to improve EPUB3.
   * Cons
      * ISO, IEC, or JTC1 has to handle minor versions such as 3.1, 3.2, and so forth.
      * Synergy between IDPF and ISO, IEC, or JTC1 can be difficult.

 * Option 2: When the EPUB3.X family becomes stable or when HTML5 and CSS3 modules referenced by EPUB3 become stable. (2013?)
   * Pros
      * ISO, IEC, or JTC1 does not have to handle minor versions such as 3.1, 3.2, and so forth.
   * Cons
      * International standardization by ISO, IEC, or JTC1 becomes rubber stamping.  It might be useful for marketing, but inputs from member bodies will not lead to positive results.
      * IDPF will have possibly started a new major version of EPUB, which may well overshadow EPUB3 in the market. 


Note that we might want to combine both options, for example option 1 for a technical specification and option 2 for an international standard.
