#summary A list of types of standards


Which  type of "standard" type at ISO, IEC, or JTC1 is appropriate for EPUB3?

 <wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

== Technical  Reports ==
This option is not viable, since the EPUB3 specifications "contain matter   implying   that   it  is normative".
This option is defined in [http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3146825/4229629/4230450/4230455/ISO_IEC_Directives%2C_Part_1_%28Procedures_for_the_technical_work%29_%282011%2C_8th_ed.%29_%28PDF_format%29.pdf?nodeid=10563026&vernum=-2 ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1: Procedures for the technical work] as below:

  3.3  Technical  Reports 

  3.3.1    When a  technical  committee or  subcommittee has collected data of  a different  kind  
  from that which is normally published as an International Standard (this may include, for 
  example, data obtained from a survey carried out among the national bodies, data on work in 
  other international organizations or data on the "state of the art" in relation to standards of 
  national bodies on a particular subject), the technical committee or subcommittee may decide, 
  by a simple majority vote of P-members voting, to request the Chief Executive Officer to
  publish such data   in  the  form of a Technical  Report .  The document  shall  be  entirely 
  informative  in  nature and shall  not  contain matter   implying   that   it  is normative.   It shall  clearly 
  explain its relationship to normative aspects of the subject  which are,  or  will  be,  dealt  within 
  International Standards related to the subject. The Chief Executive Officer, if necessary in 
  consultation with the technical management board, shall decide whether to publish the 
  document as a Technical Report. 

  3.3.2    When the P-members of a technical committee or subcommittee have agreed upon 
  the publication of  a Technical  Report ,   the draft   report  shall  be  submitted  in machine-readable 
  form by  the secretariat  of   the  technical  committee or subcommittee to the Chief Executive 
  Officer within 4 months for publication. 

  3.3.3    It is recommended that Technical Reports are regularly reviewed by the committee 
  responsible,  to ensure  that   they remain  valid.  Withdrawal  of  a Technical  Report   is  decided by 
  the technical committee or subcommittee responsible.



== PAS ==

This option is defined in [http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3146825/4229629/4230450/4230455/ISO_IEC_Directives%2C_Part_1_%28Procedures_for_the_technical_work%29_%282011%2C_8th_ed.%29_%28PDF_format%29.pdf?nodeid=10563026&vernum=-2 ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1: Procedures for the technical work] as below:

  3.2  Publicly Available Specifications (PAS)  
  
  3.2.1    A PAS may be an intermediate  specification, published prior to the development of a 
  full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a “dual logo” publication published in 
  collaboration with  an  external  organizat ion.  I t   is a document  not  fulfill ing  the  requirements   for  
  a standard. 
  
  3.2.2    A proposal for submission of a PAS may be made by an A-liaison or D-liaison (see 
  1.17.2 and 1.17.3)  or  by any P-member  of   the committee . 
  
  3.2.3    The PAS is published after verification of the presentation and checking that there is 
  no conflict with existing International Standards by the committee concerned and following 
  simple majority approval of the P-members voting of the committee concerned. 
  
  3.2.4    A PAS shall remain valid for an ini tial  maximum per iod of  3 years.  The validity may be 
  extended for a single period up to a maximum of 3 years, at the end of which it shall be 
  published as another type of normative document, or shall be withdrawn. 

 * Pros

 * Cons
   * This option might not be good enough for marketing.
