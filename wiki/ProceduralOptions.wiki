#summary A list of procedural options.

== Normal process ==

DIRECT international standardization, administered by an international
committee, using the NORMAL development process.  This process has the
following stages (See 
"2.1.3  Project stage" in [http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3146825/4229629/4230450/4230455/ISO_IEC_Directives%2C_Part_1_%28Procedures_for_the_technical_work%29_%282011%2C_8th_ed.%29_%28PDF_format%29.pdf?nodeid=10563026&vernum=-2 ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1: Procedures for the technical work]).

Some of the stages can be skipped.  At a minimum, the proposal stage, committee stage, enquiry stage and publication stage are needed, but the NP ballot and CD ballot can be combined.
