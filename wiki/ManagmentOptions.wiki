 _1.12.6  In special cases a joint working group (JWG) may be established to undertake a 
 specific task in which more than one ISO and/or IEC technical committee or subcommittee is 
 interested. The decision to establish a joint working group shall be accompanied by mutual 
 agreement  between   the committees  on: 

 - the committee/ organization having the administrative responsibility for the project; 

 - the convenor of the joint working group; 

 -  the membership  of   the  joint  working group  (membership may be open  to  all   interested  
 experts from the parent committees, or it may be decided to limit the participation to equal 
 numbers from each of the parent committee for example). _
 
 _The committee/organization with the administrative responsibility for the project shall:
 
 -  record  the project  in  their  programme of  work; _

 _- ensure that the comments and votes at all stages of the project are compiled and handled 
 appropriately (see 2.5,  2.6 and  2.7)  ; 

 - prepare drafts for the committee, enquiry and approval stages according to procedures 
 given in 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7; 

 - be responsible for maintenance of the publication.  
 A proposal to establish a joint ISO/IEC working group, including decisions on which 
 committee/organization is responsible for final publication and subsequent maintenance of the 
 publication, the joint working group convenor and membership shall be submitted for 
 information to the technical management boards (see also B.4.2.11)._

The above description does not clearly define the way projects in JWGs are handled.  
The SC34 secretariat contacted ITTF and found some more information.

 * NP ballots are conducted only in the committee/organization with the administrative responsibility for the project.

 * CD ballots are conducted in all of the involved committees in parallel, although some committees (e.g., ISO/TCs) do not conduct a ballot but merely circulate a committee draft just for comment.  Consensus within and among all committees is required to progress to the enquiry stage (DIS) .  (according to JTC 1 Supplement JA.4, ISO/IEC Directives Annex B, and information from ITTF)

 * DIS ballots are conducted as normal JTC1 (combined) ballots.

 * Comment disposition for ballots are assigned to the JWG.

It is probably a bit too early to list pros and cons of this option, but there are no mechanisms for achieving consensus within and among all committees.  Without such a mechanism, this option might prevent EPUB3 from progressing to the enquiry stage.
