 _1.12.6  In special cases a joint working group (JWG) may be established to undertake a 
 specific task in which more than one ISO and/or IEC technical committee or subcommittee is 
 interested. The decision to establish a joint working group shall be accompanied by mutual 
 agreement  between   the committees  on: 

 - the committee/ organization having the administrative responsibility for the project; 

 - the convenor of the joint working group; 

 -  the membership  of   the  joint  working group  (membership may be open  to  all   interested  
 experts from the parent committees, or it may be decided to limit the participation to equal 
 numbers from each of the parent committee for example). 
 
 The committee/organization with the administrative responsibility for the project shall:
 
 -  record  the project  in  their  programme of  work; 

 - ensure that the comments and votes at all stages of the project are compiled and handled 
 appropriately (see 2.5,  2.6 and  2.7)  ; 

 - prepare drafts for the committee, enquiry and approval stages according to procedures 
 given in 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7; 

 - be responsible for maintenance of the publication.  
 A proposal to establish a joint ISO/IEC working group, including decisions on which 
 committee/organization is responsible for final publication and subsequent maintenance of the 
 publication, the joint working group convenor and membership shall be submitted for 
 information to the technical management boards (see also B.4.2.11)._
