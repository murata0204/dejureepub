In 2010 September, after reaching consensus with the IDPF board, SC34 created an ad-hoc group for EPUB with the following terms of reference:

  * to discuss with IDPF whether their EPUB work should be standardized at SC 34 and to present a plan for such standardization and any other recommendations to the next SC 34 Plenary in 2011 March.
  * to determine the major stakeholders concerned with EPUB standardization and propose additional liaisons that would enable these stakeholders to be represented in any standardization process.
