# Common directives #

[ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1: Procedures for the technical work](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3146825/4229629/4230450/4230455/ISO_IEC_Directives%2C_Part_1_%28Procedures_for_the_technical_work%29_%282011%2C_8th_ed.%29_%28PDF_format%29.pdf?nodeid=10563026&vernum=-2) describes rules common to ISO, IEC, and ISO/IEC JTC1.



## ISO supplements ##

[ISO Supplement, Procedures specific to ISO](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=4230452&objAction=browse&sort=subtype) introduces rules specific to ISO.

Note: Some other documents specific to ISO are also available at [03 ISO Supplement (English)](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=4230452&objAction=browse&sort=subtype), but they are not very relevant to the EPUB discussions.


## IEC supplements ##

[Procedures specific to IEC](http://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiec-dir-iecsup%7Bed6.0%7Den.pdf) introduces rules specific to IEC.

Furthermore, TC100 has its own rules, which are described by [TC 100 Guidelines and Procedures](http://tc100.iec.ch/about/structure/100_1180e_INF.pdf).  This document describes the TC100-specific fast procedure.

Recently, the Standardization Management Board (SMB)  of IEC made a [decision](http://code.google.com/p/dejureepub/downloads/detail?name=AC_20118e_AC.pdf&can=2&q=) to reduce the enquiry period.



## JTC1 supplements ##

[Procedures specific to JTC 1](http://www.iso.org/jtc1supplement) introduces rules specific to JTC1.

Furthermore, JTC1 has [standing documents](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=7849325&objAction=browse&sort=name).  They also describe rules specific to JTC1.  One of them, namely Standing Document 5 is about normative references.

## ISO/IEC procedures for liaison and work allocation ##

Annex B:  _ISO/IEC procedures for liaison and work allocation_ in [Procedures specific to JTC 1](http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/3146825/4229629/4230450/9482942/JTC_1_Supplement_%28pdf_version%29.pdf?nodeid=9484244&vernum=-2) provides  procedures
for coordination and allocation of work between the technical committees and
subcommittees of both ISO and IEC.
